 * - [images]: eagerly-decoded bitmaps, one per tile. Used by the existing default path, cheap to
 *   look up but heavy on memory for long items (a 2h movie at 10s intervals is ~720 tiles).
 * - [loader]: lazy supplier that resolves a bitmap for a given position on demand (with internal
 *   LRU caching). Used by the experimental developer-toggle path so sprite-sheets only get decoded
 *   as the user scrubs near them.
 *
 * Exactly one is expected to be non-null; consumers prefer [loader] when present and fall back to
 * [images] otherwise.
