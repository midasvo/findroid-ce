 * Decides when an "Are you still watching?" prompt should fire.

 * - [autoAdvanceThreshold]: N consecutive episodes auto-played without a user touch
 * - [inactivityThresholdMs]: M milliseconds of wall-clock time since the last user touch
 *
 * Either threshold trips the prompt. A value of [OFF] for either disables that axis.
 *
 * Pure: no Android, no media3, no coroutines. Drives off whatever wall-clock the caller passes in
