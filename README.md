# Findroid CE (Community Edition)

A maintained fork of [Findroid](https://github.com/jarnedemeulemeester/findroid), the native Jellyfin Android client.

## Why this fork?

The original Findroid is an excellent Jellyfin client, but the maintainer is focused on a full Jetpack Compose rewrite. In the meantime, many community PRs with useful features aren't being merged. Findroid CE merges select community contributions and keeps dependencies up to date so you can keep using a current, feature-rich Findroid today.

## Installing

### Via Obtainium (recommended)

Add this repo URL in [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium): `https://github.com/midasvo/findroid-ce`

Obtainium will automatically check for new releases and notify you of updates.

### Manual

Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/midasvo/findroid-ce/releases) page.

Findroid CE uses a different application ID (`nl.midasvo.findroid.ce`) so it can be installed alongside the original Findroid.
